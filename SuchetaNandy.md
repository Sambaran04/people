## Bio
Hello, I am Sucheta Nandy, a 3rd year CSE undergraduate studying in Netaji Subhash Engineering College. 
I have been doing Machine Learning and Deep Learning related projects for a year now. I can code in C and python with quite proficiency. 
In my free time I love painting, playing sports(cricket specially) and listening to music. 
I am a hard working person who loves to be punctual and obey rules diligently. I am a keen and fast learner and I am always ready to boost my knowledge in every aspect of life.
