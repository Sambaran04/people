## Bio

Hey, I am Ashutosh Krishna, a 3rd year IT undergraduate. Currently, I am learning and applying my skills as a Backend Developer using Django(Python) as well as NodeJS. The love for App Development landed me in the DSC App Team and the journey has been amazing with my incredible team. In my free time, I love exploring new technlogies like Data Science and Machine Learning. 

I had always wished to join this community from my very first days of college. Looking forward to learn and grow together with this amazingly supportive community.
