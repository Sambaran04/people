## Bio
Hi! I am Satish Kumar Singh, 3rd year IT Undergrad of Netaji Subhash Engineering College. I am a front-end developer, a tech-savvy person, and proficient in React JS and React Native. In my two years of college life, I tried to gain hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, Figma, and other tools and languages. Right now, I am focussing on diving deeper into React JS and planning to build unique and user-friendly websites that will help the society. I have leadership skills as well. I love to work in a team and guide it when necessary.
